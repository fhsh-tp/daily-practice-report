## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Teacher approves a task submission

Teachers with `MANAGE_TASKS` permission SHALL be able to approve a `TaskSubmission` by calling `POST /api/submissions/{submission_id}/approve`. Approval SHALL set `status` to `"approved"`. If the submission was previously `"rejected"`, approval SHALL also create a positive `PointTransaction` to restore the revoked points (source_event: `"submission_reapproved"`).

#### Scenario: Teacher approves a pending submission

- **WHEN** a teacher calls `POST /api/submissions/{submission_id}/approve` on a pending submission
- **THEN** the system SHALL set `status` to `"approved"` and return HTTP 200
- **AND** no `PointTransaction` change SHALL occur (points were already awarded on submission)

#### Scenario: Teacher approves a previously rejected submission

- **WHEN** a teacher calls `POST /api/submissions/{submission_id}/approve` on a rejected submission
- **THEN** the system SHALL set `status` to `"approved"`
- **AND** the system SHALL create a positive `PointTransaction` equal to the class `submission_points` with `source_event: "submission_reapproved"`

### Requirement: Teacher rejects a task submission

Teachers with `MANAGE_TASKS` permission SHALL be able to reject a `TaskSubmission` by calling `POST /api/submissions/{submission_id}/reject` with a required `rejection_reason` (string) and optional `resubmit_deadline` (ISO 8601 datetime, nullable). Rejection SHALL set `status` to `"rejected"`, store the reason and deadline, and create a negative `PointTransaction` equal to the class `submission_points` (source_event: `"submission_rejected"`).

#### Scenario: Teacher rejects a submission with reason

- **WHEN** a teacher calls `POST /api/submissions/{submission_id}/reject` with a valid `rejection_reason`
- **THEN** the system SHALL set `status` to `"rejected"`, store `rejection_reason` and `resubmit_deadline`
- **AND** the system SHALL create a negative `PointTransaction` equal to `submission_points`

#### Scenario: Rejection without reason is rejected

- **WHEN** a teacher calls `POST /api/submissions/{submission_id}/reject` with an empty `rejection_reason`
- **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 422 and SHALL NOT change the submission status

#### Scenario: Teacher rejects an already-approved submission

- **WHEN** a teacher rejects a submission with `status: "approved"`
- **THEN** the system SHALL set `status` to `"rejected"` and create a negative `PointTransaction`
- **AND** the prior approval SHALL be superseded

### Requirement: Student views rejection detail page

The system SHALL provide a page at `GET /pages/student/submissions/{submission_id}/rejection` that displays the rejection reason, optional resubmit deadline, and original submission content. The page SHALL be accessible only to the owning student.

#### Scenario: Student views rejection detail

- **WHEN** a student navigates to the rejection detail page for a rejected submission
- **THEN** the page SHALL display the rejection reason, resubmit deadline (if set), and the original field values

#### Scenario: Non-owner cannot access rejection detail

- **WHEN** a different student or unauthorized user accesses the rejection page
- **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 403

### Requirement: Student resubmits a rejected task

A student whose submission has been rejected SHALL be able to submit a new task for the same date if a `resubmit_deadline` was set and has not passed. The resubmission SHALL be a new `TaskSubmission` document with `parent_submission_id` pointing to the rejected submission. The new submission SHALL trigger points and reward providers as normal.

#### Scenario: Student resubmits within deadline

- **WHEN** a student submits a task for a date where they have a rejected submission with a future `resubmit_deadline`
- **THEN** the system SHALL create a new `TaskSubmission` with `parent_submission_id` set to the rejected submission's ID
- **AND** the system SHALL award points as normal

#### Scenario: Duplicate-submission guard ignores rejected records

- **WHEN** a student attempts to submit for a date where they have only a `"rejected"` submission
- **THEN** the system SHALL allow the new submission (SHALL NOT treat the rejected record as a duplicate)

#### Scenario: No resubmit when deadline has passed or was not set

- **WHEN** a student attempts to submit for a date where their submission was rejected with no deadline or a passed deadline
- **THEN** the system SHALL display a message that resubmission is not available and SHALL NOT create a new submission

### Requirement: Student sees submission review status in activity feed

The system SHALL display task approval events in the student's activity feed. When a submission transitions to `"approved"` or `"rejected"`, a corresponding feed entry SHALL be created or surfaced so the student can see the outcome.

#### Scenario: Approved submission appears in feed

- **WHEN** a teacher approves a student's submission
- **THEN** a feed entry with event type `"submission_approved"` SHALL be visible to that student

#### Scenario: Rejected submission appears in feed

- **WHEN** a teacher rejects a student's submission
- **THEN** a feed entry with event type `"submission_rejected"` SHALL be visible to that student
- **AND** the feed entry SHALL link to the rejection detail page
